# 🔧 Vercel Runtime Error - COMPLETE FIX

## ✅ What I Fixed

The `Function Runtimes must have a valid version` error was caused by:

1. **Next.js 15 compatibility issues** with Vercel
2. **Missing proper Vercel configuration**

## 🔄 Changes Made

### 1. **Downgraded Next.js to Stable Version**
- Changed from `next: "^15.5.3"` to `next: "14.2.5"`
- Next.js 15 is still in beta and has Vercel compatibility issues

### 2. **Updated next.config.js**
- Simplified configuration for Next.js 14
- Added `experimental.appDir: true` for app directory support

### 3. **Added Proper vercel.json**
```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "installCommand": "npm install"
}
```

## 🚀 Deploy Steps

### Step 1: Re-upload to GitHub
1. **Upload ALL files** to your GitHub repository
2. **Commit message**: `"Fixed Vercel runtime error - downgraded to Next.js 14"`
3. **Make sure all files are uploaded**

### Step 2: Deploy in Vercel
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. **Delete the current project** (to start fresh)
3. **Create new project**
4. **Import from GitHub**
5. **Deploy!**

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://reportsonic:reportsonic123@cluster0.mongodb.net/reportsonic?retryWrites=true&w=majority

```

## 🎯 Why This Fixes the Error

- **Next.js 14** is fully stable and Vercel-optimized

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Next.js 15** is still in beta - avoid for production
- **Next.js 14** is the current stable version

## 🔍 If Still Having Issues

1. **Check Vercel build logs** for specific errors
