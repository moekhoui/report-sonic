# 🔧 How to Upload Folders to GitHub

## ✅ The Problem
When you upload files through GitHub web interface, it only uploads **files** and not **folders**. That's why your `pages` directory is missing!

## 🚀 Solutions

### **Option 1: Upload Folders via GitHub Web (Easiest)**

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click "Add file" → "Upload files"**
3. **Drag and drop the ENTIRE `pages` folder** from your computer
4. **Make sure you see this structure in GitHub:**
   ```
   pages/
   ├── _app.tsx
   ├── _document.tsx
   ├── index.tsx
   ├── test.tsx
   ├── api/
   │   └── hello.ts
   └── auth/
       ├── signin.tsx
       └── signup.tsx
   ```

### **Option 2: Use Git Commands (Better)**

If you have Git installed:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files and folders
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Add complete project with pages directory"

# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/report-sonic.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### **Option 3: Create Folders Manually in GitHub**

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click "Add file" → "Create new file"**
3. **Type: `pages/_app.tsx`** (this creates the folder)
4. **Copy the content from your local file**
5. **Repeat for each file in the pages directory**

## 🎯 What You Need to Upload

Make sure these folders are in your GitHub repository:

- ✅ `pages/` - **CRITICAL** (contains all your pages)
- ✅ `src/` - Contains components and utilities
- ✅ `public/` - Static assets (if any)

**DO NOT upload:**
- ❌ `node_modules/` - This is auto-generated
- ❌ `.git/` - Git metadata

## 🧪 Verify Upload

After uploading, check your GitHub repository:
1. You should see a `pages` folder
2. Click on it to see all the files inside
3. Make sure the structure is correct

## 🚀 Deploy Again

Once the `pages` folder is uploaded:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Redeploy your project
3. It should work now! ✨

The missing `pages` folder was definitely the issue! 🎯
